# Branch Process

This project uses the beehive-flow branch process (simple variant). See https://github.com/tinymce/beehive-flow/

# Publishing & Legal

1. If you add new packages remember to re-generate the LEGAL.txt by running the `./bin/generate-legal.js` script.
2. Make sure that you also include the yarn.lock file since these need to be in sync.
